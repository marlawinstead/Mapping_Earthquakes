# Mapping_Earthquakes

Mapping Earthquake Data using GeoJSON and JavaScript

The purpose of this project is to assist Basil, the head of the Earthquake Response Team for the Disaster Reporting Network with creating earthquake maps. The maps show earthquakes around the world. Larger and darker circles represent a higher earthquake magnitude. Fault lines are also present, to demonstrate the relationship between location and frequency of seismic activity and tectonic plates.
